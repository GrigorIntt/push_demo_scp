## Prerequisites

Before using this Makefile, ensure the following components are set up correctly:

### 1. Spike Simulator

The Spike RISC-V ISA simulator (`spike`) must be built and available at the following path:

```
riscv-tools/riscv-isa-sim/build/spike
```

> ⚠️ If the simulator is located elsewhere, update the corresponding path in the `Makefile`.

### 2. RISC-V GCC Toolchain

You need the `riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc` compiler, which can be built using the `riscv-gnu-toolchain`.

Make sure the toolchain binaries (e.g., `riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc`, `riscv32-unknown-elf-objdump`, etc.) are available in your system's `PATH`.

## Evaluation Logs

During execution, all evaluation logs will be saved in an `evaluation/` directory. This folder will be created automatically when the Makefile is run.
