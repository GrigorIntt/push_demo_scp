Prerequisites
-------------

Before using this Makefile, ensure the following setup is complete:

1. Spike Simulator  
   The Spike RISC-V ISA simulator (`spike`) should already be built and located at:  
   riscv-tools/riscv-isa-sim/build/spike  
   If the simulator is located elsewhere, update the corresponding path in the Makefile.

2. RISC-V GCC Toolchain  
   You must have built the `riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc` compiler using the `riscv-gnu-toolchain`.  
   Ensure that the compiler binaries are available in your system's environment `PATH`.

3. Python Virtual Environment  
   A Python virtual environment is expected at the project root, named: `.venv`.    
   If your virtual environment has a different name or location, update the relevant path in `simulation/Makefile`.
